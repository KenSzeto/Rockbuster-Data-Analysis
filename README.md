# Rockbuster Analysis Project
This project includes a preview of my work using PostgreSQL to navigate, clean, and analyze the database of the fictional Rockbuster Database as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Immersion program. 

# Objective

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive, and needs to go through historic data to create the best possible strategy for the jump to the digital marketplace.
